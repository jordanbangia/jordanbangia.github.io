Today marks the release of my newly updated site.  My previous verion was written in HTML and CSS, and used Bootstrap.  It was a simple site, meant just to be a landing page and host some links.    

The new site was created using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme, so that I can not only host all the information that I want to, but I can also post blogs/random thoughts about whats going on in my life.

When I released this site, it was released as jordanbangia.me.  I previously had the .com domain, but in the process of creating this site I lost it to Squarespace.  They didn't release my domain, so I had to wait for it to expire, then proceed to win the domain at auction ($100 bid, ugh).  After finally getting the domain back, I transfered it over to Namecheap (where my previous domain was purchased from) and now we are here.  The site is finally living where its meant to be, at jordanbangia.com.

That was one hassle that I never want to have to put up with again.

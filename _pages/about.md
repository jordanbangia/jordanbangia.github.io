I'm a graduate of the University of Toronto, class of 2015.  In my free time, I like to use software to solve everyday problems and build tools to make life a little easier.  I have experience in mobile development (mostly in Android), Big Data technologies (Hadoop, MapReduce, Storm), and some learning web technologies (Django).  I'm using Python, Java, Go, Ruby, and C# for development.

## Gaming
When I'm not doing software/tech related things, I love to play video games.  I'm an avid esports watcher and follow competitive Smite, League of Legends, Hearthstone and Overwatch (repping Cloud 9).  

Currently, I'm playing mostly Overwatch and League of Legends.  I enjoy the competitive team aspect of the games and the different strategies that can be used to win.

I sometimes stream these games over at [http://twitch.tv/jbigbangs](http://twitch.tv/jbigbangs).  Follow me there to see when I go live and check some of these games out.

### Food and Drink
I'm a huge foodie and beer fan as well.  I love trying different foods, cuisines, and beers, mostly local and craft varieties.


### Travel

I like to travel, and have been able to see a lot of Europe, with recent trips to Scotland, Ireland, and the Netherlands.  I take my camera with me every time, and a lot of the photos can be seen on this site.  In the future, I'd like to be able to travel through Asia.

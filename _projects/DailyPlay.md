DailyPlay is an app I created to solve a pretty simple problem that I was experiencing.  

In the summer of 2014, I was working and living in downtown Toronto.  I would take the subway to and from work everyday, and on these trips I would usually like to listen to music on my Android phone.  Now, I, like most people, have many songs in my music library (I think I'm at upwards of 10000 right now).  Obviously all these songs don't fit on my device.  I'm also a Google Play Music user, so my songs are available on the cloud, but unfortunately that aren't accessible underground on the subway lines.

I used to just put a bunch of songs (100 or so) on my device.  I would listen to those for a couple days/weeks, and it would be fine but eventually I would get bored of the music.  I didn't want to have to deal with putting new music on my device everyday, so I created DailyPlay to solve this problem.

Phones for the most part don't have the capacity for your entire library, and trying to choose a single set of songs to keep on your device can be difficult.  Over time, if you don't replace those songs they become stale and constantly changing them is an unnecessary hassle.  DailyPlay aims to fix this by randomly choosing songs from your Google Play music library and creating a daily playlist of music for you.  Keep your commute music exciting, never let your library get stale, and rediscover the music that you already own.

- It's Your Music: You probably have a large music library and is already likely on the cloud.  DailyPlay downloads songs from your Google Play Music library, so the playlist you get is always made from your own personal collection.

- No Data Needed: DailyPlay downloads the playlist at night so that it can use your Wi-Fi connection, avoiding downloading over data.  Your new music is then ready every night for your morning commute.

- Perfect Length Playlist: Whether its spending 30 minutes commuting or needing 10 songs to power through at the gym, DailyPlay can be customized to download exactly the amount of time or number of songs you want, so that you always get the perfect length playlist.

The app was available on the Google Play Store, but unfortunately due to a breaking API change, it had to be taken down, but should be fixed soon.
